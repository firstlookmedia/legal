# Warrant Canary Statement

First Look Media's "warrant canary" lets the public know that we have not received a secret subpoena, warrant or other legal compulsion that we are prohibited from disclosing, such as a National Security Letter. In the event the company is issued such a legal process, our plan is to not publish a canary statement during that period.

Within the first week of every quarter, we publish a canary statement that covers the previous quarter. We digitally sign our canary statements using [this PGP key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firstlookmedia/legal/master/canary/signing-key.asc), with the fingerprint 91C0C982A41F8D3939531A71FAB737F9C5C1CA80.
